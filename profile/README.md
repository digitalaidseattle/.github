## Introduction

Digital Aid Seattle aims to amplify community impact with technology by connecting organizations who need technical solutions with skilled volunteers.

People across thousands of Seattle civic and nonprofit organizations have dedicated their lives to making the world safer, more equitable, and more sustainable. This work is responsible for so much good in the world, and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.

Unfortunately, many of these organizations lack access to digital tools that are vital to success in the modern age. Nonprofits struggle to create and scale their impact without the resources they need.

Just outside their doors is a fleet of experts and technologists with the talent, capacity, and drive to build.

Seattle is world-renowned as a hub for technology talent, full of motivated builders, designers, and creators that want to use their skills for good. Digital Aid Seattle is bringing these communities together to create a sum greater than its parts.
